  "score": 0,
  "reasoning": "The candidate demonstrated no technical depth, failing to go even 1-2 levels deep on any topic. When probed on the race car ECU tuning, they vaguely mentioned using 'issue tech and Charge GPT' for fuel line tweaks and injector percentages, but refused to discuss specifics like code or pulse widths, saying 'Don't really wanna talk about it' and questioning relevance. On the logistics tracking system, they described using 'government approved formulas' (misstated as EBA instead of EPA) from lookup tables digitized from a 'book,' with no explanation of implementation, variables, or schema\u2014e.g., when asked about database structure, they wanted to 'wrap it up' after providing no details. This shows no ownership or understanding of technical decisions.\n\nCommunication was poor, with rambling, incomplete sentences (e.g., 'Use the I use the issue tech and and the Charge GPT'), evasion of probes, and off-topic complaints like 'how is this related to technical and video.' They showed no engineering mindset, relying on manual driver inputs, supervisor checks via odometer without GPS, and punitive measures ('hold the money') rather than discussing tradeoffs, alternatives, or initiative. Cultural fit was absent, with minimal engagement\u2014only asking 'Is this fun working there?' and no follow-up questions about x.ai despite the prompt.",
  "summary": "The interview covered the candidate's 'race car' (quickly pivoted from due to reluctance) and a logistics tracking system for fuel efficiency via post-trip calculations using EPA formulas, lookup tables from a handbook, and manual driver/supervisor validations without GPS. The candidate performed poorly, providing vague details, resisting deep dives, and showing disinterest, resulting in a clear rejection.",
