  "score": 0,
  "reasoning": "The candidate demonstrated zero technical depth, communication, problem-solving, or cultural fit, failing every evaluation criterion. There was no response to the core question 'What's the most exceptional thing you've built?' or any deep dive probing, as the candidate immediately stated 'not a good time' and 'now. Can you wrap? call?', refusing to engage in the interview. This shows no ownership of technical implementation, no explanation of technologies or decisions, and complete lack of responsiveness to follow-up opportunities.\n\nCommunication was entirely absent; the candidate did not articulate any thought process, explain concepts, or stay on topic, instead opting for abrupt dismissal with 'Alright. Bye.' This indicates poor communication skills and no ability to handle even basic interaction, let alone complex technical discussions. The engineering mindset and cultural fit are unassessable but evidently poor, with no evidence of initiative, interest in x.ai, or comfort with ambiguity\u2014in fact, the opposite, as they rejected the fast-paced screening process outright.",
  "summary": "The interview lasted mere moments with no substantive discussion; the agent greeted the candidate, but the candidate immediately declined participation by saying 'not a good time' and requesting to 'wrap? call?', leading to an abrupt end with 'Alright. Bye.' The candidate showed no engagement, provided zero technical details or project explanations, and exhibited complete disinterest, resulting in a clear rejection.",
