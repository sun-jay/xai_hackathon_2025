  "score": 0,
  "reasoning": "The candidate's response was entirely absent, as the transcript only contains the agent's incomplete greeting ('Hey there, I'm Grok') with no candidate input or answers provided. There are no examples of technical depth, as no project was described, no probing occurred, and no technical decisions were explained\u2014failing all aspects of the Technical Depth criterion (40%). Similarly, Communication (30%) cannot be evaluated positively without any candidate speech, responsiveness, or articulation of thought process. The lack of any substantive interaction means Problem-Solving & Engineering Mindset (20%) and Cultural Fit (10%) show zero evidence of thoughtful decisions, ownership, or interest in x.ai.",
  "summary": "The interview transcript is incomplete, containing only the agent's partial greeting and no candidate responses, discussion of projects, deep dives, or questions about x.ai. As a result, the candidate demonstrated no technical ability, communication skills, or fit for the role, warranting a strong rejection.",
