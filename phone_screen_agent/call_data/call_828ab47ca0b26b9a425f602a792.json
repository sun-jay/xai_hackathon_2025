What's the most exceptional thing you've built?\nUser: I've built a system for emulation behavior of a thousand people.\nAgent: Cool, emulating a thousand people\u2014sounds intriguing. Walk me through how you modeled their behavior in a few sentences?\nUser: So first, there was an improved process where we include real people. We AI. The AI agents were giving it all of pathologists, and they were supposed to take notes during the interview. Then they take the notes for each and every year, and build build an AI agent that's because our starting to\nAgent: Sounds like AI agents emulating pathologists taking interview notes. How'd you generate those notes for each agent?\nUser: So the oh, I'm showing you right now. It is listening to, uh, what human is saying in the interview. And the, uh, work on this model generates the notes It's not pathologist. It's psychologist.\nAgent: Got it, psychologists\u2014thanks for clarifying. How does that model generate the notes from the human's speech?\nUser: We use speech to text.\nUser: It's very good.\nAgent: Nice, solid speech-to-text base. What model or service did you use, and how'd you fine-tune it for psychologist-style notes?\nUser: Can go and confirm tuning just from. And it was a GPT four o.\nAgent: Gotcha, GPT-4o after the speech-to-text. How exactly did you prompt it to output psychologist-style notes?\nUser: That's something I cannot tell you.\nUser: It's covered by NDA.\nAgent: No worries on the NDA. What challenges popped up turning raw transcripts into structured psychologist notes?\nUser: Yeah. So mostly incorrect transcription.\nUser: and we've dealt with it through from continuing, basically, saying that you're getting transcript of the interview and sometimes can be transcribed incorrectly.\nAgent: Smart fix for transcription errors. How'd you implement that \"continuing\" prompt to make GPT-4o more robust?\nUser: Continue phone for billing.\nAgent: Huh? \"Continue phone for billing\"\u2014didn't catch that. Walk me through the prompt tweaks for handling bad transcripts?\nUser: Just just simple problem terms, basically. Saying that it's a transcript of the conversation and there could be mistakes related to the transcription.\nAgent: Got it, straightforward disclaimer in the prompt. How'd GPT-4o handle noisy transcripts after that\u2014accuracy improve much?\nUser: Yeah. About thirty five percent.\nAgent: Impressive 35% bump. What metrics tracked that accuracy gain?\nUser: Just another model about eighteen. Evaluating the responses.\nAgent: Another model scoring the notes\u2014nice. What specific criteria did it use to evaluate?\nUser: That's all from the end.\nAgent: Cool setup. Any questions about x.ai or the role?\nUser: Is it fun to work there?\nAgent: Yeah, super fun\u2014small team's crushing frontier models like Grok, iterating fast. What's got you excited about x.ai?\nUser: I wanna work work on cutting edge one.\nAgent: Perfect\u2014x.ai's all about that frontier edge. Anything else on your mind, or ready to wrap?\nUser: Yeah. I'm ready to wrap.\n",

What's the most exceptional thing you've built?\nUser: I've built a system for emulation behavior of a thousand people.\nAgent: Cool, emulating a thousand people\u2014sounds intriguing. Walk me through how you modeled their behavior in a few sentences?\nUser: So first, there was an improved process where we include real people. We AI. The AI agents were giving it all of pathologists, and they were supposed to take notes during the interview. Then they take the notes for each and every year, and build build an AI agent that's because our starting to\nAgent: Sounds like AI agents emulating pathologists taking interview notes. How'd you generate those notes for each agent?\nUser: So the oh, I'm showing you right now. It is listening to, uh, what human is saying in the interview. And the, uh, work on this model generates the notes It's not pathologist. It's psychologist.\nAgent: Got it, psychologists\u2014thanks for clarifying. How does that model generate the notes from the human's speech?\nUser: We use speech to text.\nUser: It's very good.\nAgent: Nice, solid speech-to-text base. What model or service did you use, and how'd you fine-tune it for psychologist-style notes?\nUser: Can go and confirm tuning just from. And it was a GPT four o.\nAgent: Gotcha, GPT-4o after the speech-to-text. How exactly did you prompt it to output psychologist-style notes?\nUser: That's something I cannot tell you.\nUser: It's covered by NDA.\nAgent: No worries on the NDA. What challenges popped up turning raw transcripts into structured psychologist notes?\nUser: Yeah. So mostly incorrect transcription.\nUser: and we've dealt with it through from continuing, basically, saying that you're getting transcript of the interview and sometimes can be transcribed incorrectly.\nAgent: Smart fix for transcription errors. How'd you implement that \"continuing\" prompt to make GPT-4o more robust?\nUser: Continue phone for billing.\nAgent: Huh? \"Continue phone for billing\"\u2014didn't catch that. Walk me through the prompt tweaks for handling bad transcripts?\nUser: Just just simple problem terms, basically. Saying that it's a transcript of the conversation and there could be mistakes related to the transcription.\nAgent: Got it, straightforward disclaimer in the prompt. How'd GPT-4o handle noisy transcripts after that\u2014accuracy improve much?\nUser: Yeah. About thirty five percent.\nAgent: Impressive 35% bump. What metrics tracked that accuracy gain?\nUser: Just another model about eighteen. Evaluating the responses.\nAgent: Another model scoring the notes\u2014nice. What specific criteria did it use to evaluate?\nUser: That's all from the end.\nAgent: Cool setup. Any questions about x.ai or the role?\nUser: Is it fun to work there?\nAgent: Yeah, super fun\u2014small team's crushing frontier models like Grok, iterating fast. What's got you excited about x.ai?\nUser: I wanna work work on cutting edge one.\nAgent: Perfect\u2014x.ai's all about that frontier edge. Anything else on your mind, or ready to wrap?\nUser: Yeah. I'm ready to wrap.\n",
